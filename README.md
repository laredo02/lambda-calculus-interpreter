# lambda-calculus-interpreter
Simple Haskell implementation of the Lambda Calculus. I will extend it over time to implement it's Timply and Dependently Typed counterparts, it will serve as as implementation of the theoretical research I do do for my Master's thesis in Type Theory and Closed Cartesian Categories.
